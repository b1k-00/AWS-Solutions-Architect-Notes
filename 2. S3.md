## S3 Overview
Simple Storage Service (S3) provides secure, durable, highly scalable object storage.
- Upload any file type to S3
  - Example: photos, videos, code, documents, logs, and text files.
- Cannot be used to run an operating system or database.

S3 allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web at a very low cost.
  - S3 provides unlimited storage for your objects.
  - Objects can be up to 5TB in size.
  - Think as S3 buckets as folders.

  ### Working with S3 buckets
  - All AWS accounts share the S3 namespace. Each S3 bucket name is globally unique. Think of S3 buckets names as domain names, once a S3 bucket name has been registered it's no longer available for use

  Example S3 URL:
  https://myfirsts3bucket.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/<Filename.extension>
