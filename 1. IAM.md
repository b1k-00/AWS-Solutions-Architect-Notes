## What is IAM?
IAM stands for identity access management. It allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console.
- Create users and grant permissions to those users.
- Create group and roles.
- Control access to AWS resources.
- IAM(Users & Groups) is a global action. You do not have to create users for each region.

### IAM Best Practices
- Never use the root account to perform tasks. The root account has full administrative rights to all AWS resources.
- Enable MFA for the root account.
- Create user accounts for your administrators.
- Add users to your admin group.

[Overview of JSON policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html#access_policies-json)

### Policy Documents Best Practices
Do not assign policy documents to users. This becomes difficult to manage as the amount of users increase.

You should add users to groups and assign the policy document to the group. The user then inherits the groups permissions.
