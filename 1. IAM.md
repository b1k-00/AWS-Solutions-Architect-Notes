## What is IAM?
[AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/faqs/)

IAM stands for identity access management. It allows you to manage users and their level of access to the AWS console.
- Create users and grant permissions to those users.
- Create group and roles.
- Control access to AWS resources.

### IAM Best Practices
- Never use the root account to perform tasks. The root account has full administrative rights to all AWS resources.
- Enable MFA for the root account.
- Create user accounts for your administrators.
- Add users to your admin group.
